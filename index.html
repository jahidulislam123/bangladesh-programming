                <h1>BANGLADESH</h1>
                <p>Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the Bengal region.[17] According to the ancient
                    Indian texts, Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata, the Vanga Kingdom, one of the namesakes of the Bengal
                    region, was a strong naval power. In the ancient and classical periods of the Indian subcontinent,
                    the territory was home to many principalities, including the Pundra, Gangaridai, Gauda, Samatata,
                    and Harikela. It was also a Mauryan province under the reign of Ashoka. The principalities were
                    notable for their overseas trade, contacts with the Roman world, the export of fine muslin and silk
                    to the Middle East, and spreading of philosophy and art to Southeast Asia. The Gupta Empire, Pala
                    Empire, the Chandra dynasty, and the Sena dynasty were the last pre-Islamic Bengali middle kingdoms.
                    Islam was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade with the Abbāsid Caliphate,[18] but
                    following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyār Khaljī, the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and
                    preaching of Shah Jalāl in the north-east, it spread across the entire region. In 1576, the wealthy
                    Bengal Sultanate was absorbed into the Mughal Empire,</p>
